# [Quantum Cryptography Website]

This is a website I created as part of a Theoretical Physics project.

I created both a website and an academic poster (using LaTeX) on quantum cryptography, the latter of which I presented to theoretical physics academics and in laymanâ€™s terms to patent attorneys from Forresters. I made the website (targeted at A-level students) using a Bootstrap code template (https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/resume/).
